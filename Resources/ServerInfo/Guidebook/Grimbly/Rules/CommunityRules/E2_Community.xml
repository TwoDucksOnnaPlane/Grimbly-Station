  # Rule E2: Use English and be respectful
  Grimbly Station is an English-based Community;

   - Use English as your primary method of communication within the game and Grimbly Station servers.
   - Do not spam or advertise on our server.
   - Be respectful towards other members and avoid making others uncomfortable.
   - We have a zero tolerance policy for racism, sexism, homophobia, violence, threats, hate speech, slurs, and other forms of bigotry, discrimination, and harassment.
    Slurs and terms that use real or implied mental or physical disability to mock or denigrate members or their in-game characters are also strictly prohibited. Failure to comply with this rule will result in community removal.
   - The denigration of other player characters through reference to their species/morphotype or debasement by comparison to nonsapients on a discriminatory basis is strictly prohibited and may result in an appeal-only ban.
   - Do not excessively complain in Dead, LOOC, or OOC channels. This further extends to complaining about the current or prior round in the Grimbly Station discord. If you have an issue aHelp it or go to the help channel in the discord. Excessive complaining (also known as being an OOC baby) does not add to the experience for anyone and makes you liable to administrative action.
